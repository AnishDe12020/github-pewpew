## Installation and Usage
To install the latest version of github-pewpew CLI, run this command:
```
npm i -g github-pewpew
```

To quickly start using it, run the following command:
```
ghpew
```


## Why?
Have you ever had too much fun with the GitHub API and ended up creating too many dummy repos? Me too ðŸ˜…!

I made this little CLI tool to clean up repositories quickly. I'm planning to add some flags and regexp to delete in bulk in the future. [Let me know](http://twitter.com/adrianmg) if that sounds interesting to you.

## TODO
- `--force` flag to avoid confirmation
- `--regex` flag to delete repos matching a regex
- `--list` flag to delete repos from a comma-separated list
