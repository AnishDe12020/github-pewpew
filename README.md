![Preview of the tool](preview.gif "Preview of the tool")

Have you ever had too much fun with the GitHub API and ended up creating too many dummy repositories? Me too ðŸ˜…!

I made this little CLI tool over the weekend to clean up repositories quickly. I'm planning to add some flags and regexp to delete in bulk in the future. [Let me know](http://twitter.com/adrianmg) if that sounds interesting to you.

ðŸ”« Pew pew those unnecessary GitHub repos!

## Install

Simply run `npm install github-pewpew` and you are good to go. Remember you will need a PAT (Personal Access Token) to authenticate with your GitHub account.

You can generate a PAT scoped to 'delete_repo' on https://github.com/settings/tokens.

## Questions? Ideas? Bugs?

Thanks!
